# Amazon-Products-Review-Analysis
A detailed Excel analytics project on Amazon Product Review during my time at DSA Incubator Hub. This project contains calculated fields, pivot tables, and interactive dashboard uncovering trends in ratings, reviews, pricing and category performance.

* Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings

* Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content

* Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values

## Tools Used
