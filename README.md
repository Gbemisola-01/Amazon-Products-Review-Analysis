# Amazon-Products-Review-Analysis
A detailed Excel analytics project on Amazon Product Review during my time at DSA Incubator Hub. This project contains calculated fields, pivot tables, and interactive dashboard uncovering trends in ratings, reviews, pricing and category performance.

## Project Overview
As a Junior Analyst at RetailTech Insights, a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon. I was tasked with analyzing products and customer review data to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and engagement.

## Data Source 
The primary data source used in this project is Amazon case study, which contains information scraped from Amazon product pages, including:

* Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings

* Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content

* Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Power Query Editor
- Pivot Tables
- Calculated Columns
- Excel Dashboard Design

## Analysis Tasks
